### Hello WorldðŸ‘‹
This is my journey to learning GitHub and how to integrate my data coding (through R) into this software. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on... my dissertation! Which is how people's identity can expand to include the more-than-human world and how this affects their carbon-reduction behavior. While none of this has anything to do with coding and programming, I spend a lot of time in R analysing data. I want to get better at streamlining this process!
